<p>Hi! My name is Caesar Pang. I&#8217;m currently a Year 2 student studying Computer Science, in School of Computing (SOC) in NUS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of TutorAid, which is a
project that my team and I completed for the module CS2103T. This project has definitely taught me many skills that
are extremely relevant in the real world and in the future. It has allowed me
to be a more competent and knowledgeable software engineer.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TutorAid is an easy-to-use Command Line Interface (CLI) [i.e issue commands to the program by typing in text inputs ] based application with a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) [i.e. allows users to interact with the application through visual and graphical elements] that helps to makes the lives of tutors easier
by organizing their workflow and making tutors more efficient. With a myriad of features such as student profile tracking,
earnings, reminders, notes and tasks all in one application, tutors no longer have to search through their notes one-by-one excruciatingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The features of TutorAid has been well-thought out, keeping in mind the necessities and wants of tutors alike. To meet the
exact needs of our target audience, we have conducted several surveys to ask current tutors what they would like in an
application and thus, TutorAid was created. All of TutorAid&#8217;s features and implementations are well documented with proper visualization
in guides for users and developers respectively.</p>

<h2 id="role"><a class="link" href="#role">Role</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main role was to prototype and develop the Login feature and the Earnings Tracker feature.
The login command required me to think of how to put up a login window that only shows the main window when the user
has logged in successfully. It also required me to think of how to encrypt the passwords stored and how to check whether they
 are valid as well. I also did the Earning feature where it tracks what earnings you have earned throughout the weeks. Developing it further, I decided to
add a automated earnings addition to save the users time. It has a claim status that
allows you to see if you have claimed your earnings from your respective faculties.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Largest Enhancement</strong>: Auto addition of earnings.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows the user to auto add all of the earnings of the day (provided that the earnings is a weekly routine), into the earnings list with only one short <code>auto</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as a Tutor, it is normal to have tutorials or labs or consultations to give
at the same day of the week, every week. If a tutor, for example, has many lessons in a day to teach, he/she has to add the earnings into the list one by one, which is
extremely hard and tedious to do. If the tutor has added the earnings into the list once already, the tutor can repeat this earnings by invoking the <code>weekly_earnings</code> command and the
number of times to add into the list. Afterwards, the tutor just has to invoke the <code>auto</code> command on the day itself to auto add all his routine lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation: This enhancement alters how TutorAid is used. Instead of just being a normal, "key in earnings" tracker, the addition of such a feature has helped to
ease the use of earnings tracking for the users. This is facilitated by the use of a HashMap in the Earnings list. This HashMap only has at most 7 keys as these keys are
determined by the name of the days in a week. Inside the HashMap, there are ArrayList mapped as the values of the HashMap. This feature consists of 2 main commands. The first command is <code>weekly_earnings INDEX count/COUNT</code> and the second command is <code>auto</code>. Users have to add the earnings that they want to repeat over the weeks manually first. After they have added the earnings, they can invoke the <code>weekly_earnings</code> command to auto add the earnings for the next few weeks depending on the number of counts they have inputted. The <code>weekly_earnings</code> command add the key-value pair to a HashMap in <code>Earnings</code> class. Once the user invokes the <code>auto</code> command, the parser will check the current day of the week and
get the value of the HashMap that is associated with the key value (that is the day of the week). If there exists an ArrayList, the parser will check through the entire list and
check if the Earnings in the ArrayList has more than a <code>Count</code> of 0. If the <code>Count</code> is more than zero, then the parser adds the <code>Earnings</code> object into the current list. If the <code>Count</code> is zero, the <code>Earnings</code> object would be removed from the ArrayList.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong>: Register and Login feature.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows the user to register and login into the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as a Tutor, you would enter in critical and
sensitive information of your students and of your earnings. By adding a register and login feature, it makes the
app a lot more secure and tutors can confidently enter data into their application worry-free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation: This enhancement alters the way TutorAid is used. Normally, users could enter into the application once they launched it.
 But with the register and login feature, it only allows users to login when they have the correct credentials. The register and login feature is aided by a password encryption method.
When users register, the passwords of the accounts created will be hashed with a salt so that there will be more security.
I created a Login Window as well so that the users can have a visual cue when they login into their account.</p>

If there are <code>Earnings</code> object associated with the current day of the week and the <code>Earnings</code> object has a <code>Count</code> object associated
with it that is more than 1. The earnings inside the <code>ArrayList</code> inside the <code>HashMap</code> would be added into the earnings list.</p>

<p><strong>Example Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1: The user enters <code>auto</code> to add all his days earnings into the earnings list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2: <code>LogicManager</code> would use <code>TutorAidParser#parse()</code> to parse input from the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3: <code>TutorAidParser</code> would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is <code>auto</code>, thus, <code>AutoCommand</code> object would be created with the user&#8217;s input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4: <code>LogicManager</code> would execute <code>AutoCommand#execute</code>. In this particular method, the <code>execute</code> command would check the day of the week.
It would then check with the <code>HashMap</code> to check if there is any <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Earnings</code> object to be added in. If there is no <code>ArrayList</code> available, no earnings would be added.
 If there is an <code>ArrayList</code> mapped to the day of the week, the method would then check through every <code>Earnings</code> object in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In each <code>Earnings</code> object, there is a <code>Count</code> object associated to it.
If the <code>Count</code> object has a more than 1, the <code>Earnings</code> object would be added into the current earnings list. If the <code>Count</code> object has a value of 0, the <code>Earnings</code> object would be removed from the <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 6: <code>AutoCommand</code> would then return a <code>CommandResult</code> to <code>LogicManager</code>, which would show the user that the new <code>Earnings</code>
object have been successfully added to the list.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All accounts are stored in a JSON file called accountslist.json. This file is generated once you register an account. The username
and password is stored inside the the JSON file with salt hashing thus, the account details cannot be seen by everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Design Considerations</strong>
We realised that storing the accounts by itself would allow anyone to see the username and passwords. Hence, we decided to
use a password authentication method and salt hashing to cover the passwords of the accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, we decided to go with using a JSON file instead of XML file due to these considerations:</p>

<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong>
As of now, only password hashing is done to protect the accounts from being seen by unwanted eyes. We have planned ahead of time and decided
to implement better security options for v2.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Store accounts on a backend server:</strong> The project restricts us and as of now, it is not implemented. The advantages of storing the accounts in  database
is that it can be a lot more secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encrypt the Account JSON file:</strong> This will prevent other users from easily clicking into the data file and make it more secure.</p>
