== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Earnings Feature

==== Add Earnings

The `add_earnings` command allows for tutors to add their earnings into TutorAid.

The format for the `add_earnings` command is as follows:

 add_earnings d/<DATE> type/<TYPE> c/<CLASSID> amt/<AMOUNT>

*Overview*

The add claim `add_earnings` mechanism is facilitated by `AddEarningsCommand` and `AddEarningsCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `Date`, `Type`, `ClassId`, `Amount`, which will construct `Earnings` objects.

.Add Earnings Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddEarningsSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `AddEarningsCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddEarningsCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
 individual objects based on the prefixes `d/`, `c/` and `amt/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
 will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the respectives objects.

** `date` would use `ParserUtil#parseDate()` to ensure that the date typed by the user is in the correct format of
DD/MM/YYYY.

** `type` would use `ParserUtil#parseType()` to ensure that the type entered by the user is valid.

** `classId` would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()` to ensure that the class id typed in by the user is in the correct format.

** `amount` would use `ParserUtil#parseAmount()` to ensure that the amount entered by the user is in the correct format with
2 decimal places to represent the cents.

* After validation of the individual objects, an `Earnings` object would be created with the parameters `date`, `type`, `classId`
 and `amount`.

* `AddEarningsCommandParser` would then return a `AddEarningsCommand` object with the parameter, `Earnings` object.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command.

image::AddEarningsActivityDiagram.png[]

*Example Scenerio*


* Step 1: The user enters `add_earnings d/04/08/2019 c/CS1231 amt/50.00` to add an earning for teaching classes.
This adds an `Earnings` object that the user has earned by teaching a CS1231 class on 4th August 2019. The user has
earned $50.00.

* Step 2: `LogicManager` would use `AddressBookParser#parse()` to parse input from the user.

* Step 3: `AddressBookParser` would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is `add_earnings`, thus, `AddEarningsCommandParser` object would be created with the user's input.

* Step 4: `AddEarningsCommandParser` performs a validation check on each of the respective objects through
`AddEarningsCommandParser#parse()`. In this case, it would use `ParserUtil#parseDate()`, `ParserUtil#parseType()`, `ParserUtil#parseClassId()`
and `ParserUtil#parseAmount()`. It would then return a `AddEarningsCommand` object with an `Earnings` object.

* Step 5: `LogicManager` would execute `AddEarningsCommand#execute`. In this particular method, the `Earnings` object will be
check with the rest of the prior `Earnings` object, to ensure that there is no duplicate `Earnings` object. If there are no similar
`Earnings` object with the same parameters created previously, it would then be added into the earnings list.

* Step 6: `AddEarningsCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new `Earnings`
object have been successfully added.

=== Calendar Feature

=== Add Tasks
The `add_task` command allows for tutors to add their tasks into TutorAid.

The format for the `add_task` command is as follows:

 add_task c/<CLASSID> mark/<MARKING> tt/<TASKTIME> ...

*Overview*

The add claim `add_task` mechanism is facilitated by `AddTaskCommand` and `AddTaskCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `ClassId`, `Marking`, `TaskTime` which will construct `Task` objects.

.Add Task Command Sequence Diagram

The `AddTaskCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddTaskCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
individual objects based on the prefixes `c/`, `mark/` and `tt/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the respectives objects.

** `classId` would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()` to ensure that the class id typed in by the user is in the correct format.

** `mark` would use `ParserUtil#parseMarking()` to ensure that the Marking entered by the user is in the correct format with only "Y" or "N".

** `taskTime` would use `ParseUtil#parseTaskTimes()` to ensure that the TaskTime entered by the user is in the correct format.

* After validation of the individual objects, an `Task` object would be created with the parameters `classId`, `Marking`,
and `taskTime`.

* `AddTaskCommandParser` would then return a `AddTaskCommand` object with the parameter, `Task` object.

// tag::learncustomcommands[]
=== Learn wrong commands as custom commands feature
==== Implementation
The main point of this feature is to learn a user's typing habits so as to give them a more seamless experience
while using TutorAid by adapting to their typing style so that they do not have to memorize
built in commands.

The sequence of events is triggered when a user accidentally inputs a wrong command. TutorAid will then prompt
the user on whether or not they wish to add this command to the library as a custom command mapped to the action of a built in command.

Custom command keywords and their mappings are stored locally in addressbook.json with
the help of `JsonAdaptedCommand`.

The whole mechanism is mainly facilitated by `AddressBookParser` which has been modified to suit our needs. A TreeMap
is now being used in the process of parsing commands.

A `CommandResult` object now also has an added boolean "unknown" instance variable to indicate if the command entered is
an unknown command. New command classes such as `UnknownCommand`, `NewCommand` and `CancelCommand` were also created.

* `AddressBookParser#checkCommand()` -- Separate "parser" functions for unknown command operations.
Checks if the command a user wants to map his unknown command to is valid and exists or if the user wishes
to exit the operation.
* `AddressBookParser#initialiseBasicCommands()` -- Initialises the functionality of the `AddressBookParser` by adding
the basic command mappings to its TreeMap.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the learn custom command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBookParser` will be initialized and all basic
commands and previous existing custom commands will be added to its TreeMap.

Step 2. The user enters "plus" instead of "add". `AddressBookParser` does a lookup in its TreeMap and in the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` function and returns a new `UnknownCommand` since
the TreeMap does not contain the keyword "plus".

Step 3. The `UnknownCommand` is executed in `LogicManger` and "plus" is saved on a Stack in `ModelManager`. Subsequently, the `CommandResult` is passed to `MainWindow` to display the corresponding text on the GUI. The `CommandResult` triggers `CommandResult#isUnknown()` and sets the "unknown" variable in `MainWindow`
to true.

[NOTE]
`Logic#execute(String userInput)` has been changed to `Logic#execute(String userInput, boolean isUnknown)` to account for different execution pathways of unknown and known commands.

Step 4. TutorAid prompts the user to type in a valid command to map the unknown command to. The user types in another wrong command that is not recognised. This time, he enters "ad" instead of "add". `LogicManager#execute(String userInput, boolean isUnknown)` now calls `AddressBookParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)` as `MainWindow` passed in a value of "true" to the execute command.

Step 5. In `AddressBookParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)`, the command is still not recognized and another `UnknownCommand` is returned.
Steps 3-5 occurs continuously as long as an unknown command is being supplied or until the user cancels the operation by typing in "cancel".

Step 7. The user inputs a valid command. `AddressBookParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)` now finds the valid command in the TreeMap. With the latest "prevUnknownCommand" retrieved from the stack, it adds the unknown command and action of the valid command as a key-value pair to the TreeMap and as a new CommandObject to the `AddressBook` for storage via execution of `NewCommand` object.

Step 8. `NewCommand` has a `CommandResult` with an "unknown" value of false. This will trigger `MainWindow#setUnknownFalse()` and set the unknown variable in `MainWindow` to false. Normal commands can then be performed as `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` will now be called again instead of `AddressBookParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the learn custom command operation works:

Firstly an unknown command is supplied,

image::UnknownCommandDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UnknownCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

After which, a known command is supplied,

image::NewCommandDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
`AddressBookParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)` is called instead of the normal `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` function because the boolean input "isUnknown" in `Logic#execute(String userInput, boolean isUnknown)` is set to true.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::LearnCustomCommandsActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the learning of custom commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add all CommandObject objects in the ObservableList<CommandObject> into a TreeMap.
** Pros: Future queries to determine if a command exists or not only requires O(1) time.
** Cons: The first iteration to populate the TreeMap still takes O(n) time.
* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through the ObservableList<CommandObject> to check if the command exists.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate data structure, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. We also
do not need to waste time populating a TreeMap.
** Cons: Every single query costs O(n) time to check if the command exists.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
