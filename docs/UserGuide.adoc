== Introduction

TutorAid is for teaching assistants or tutors who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their classes and related tasks. More importantly, TutorAid is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorAid can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `tutoraid.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TutorAid.
